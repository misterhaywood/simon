Thanks for checking this out.

This is the Simon Game, written with love in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Rules: I play a pattern, and you repeat. Simple right?

I was able to code this game in HTML, JS and CSS. After researching how Simon works, I set out split up the game as follows:

[Rounds](https://github.com/misterhaywood/simon/blob/2528bd6131c83eeeaebacd325601114a43d88525/script.js#L49): The computer and player both take turns until 20 rounds of gameplay has happened, or the player does not successfully memorize the round.
